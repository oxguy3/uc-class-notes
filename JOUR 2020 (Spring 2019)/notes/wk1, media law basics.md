## courts

Trial courts —> Appeal court —> Supreme Court

* trial courts
  * jury decides the **facts**, judge rules on **law**
  * two types of courts
    - Municipal Court (or County Court) for misdemeanors (criminal) or <$15k (civil)
    - Common Pleas Court for felonies (criminal) or >$15k (civil)
  * bench trial = if you waive your right to a jury of peers, judge acts as jury

* courts of appeals
  * only deal in matters of **law**, not fact
  * can't overturn jury decision
    * (unless it's for law-based reason, e.g. jury discrimination)
* supreme court

## definition of law

peaceful method for the resolution of disputes

## sources of law

1. **statutory law**: the written laws, passed by legislatures

  * criminal codes
    * e.g. U.S. Code, Ohio Revised Code
    * stuff you can be jailed for
  * civil codes
    * torts
1. **case or common law**: what courts have previously ruled

  * only binding within the district where the case law occurred
    * (but generally, districts follow each others' case law)
1. **equity law**: injunctions passed down by judges

  * e.g. "released on bail but can't do X"
1. **administrative law**: regulations that carry out intent of statutory laws

  * statutory law is broad, so regulations fill in the details

  * e.g. OSHA, landlord laws, zoning laws, health dept, etc
1. **executive orders**: orders issued by president or governor

  * restricted by DoJ guidelines
  * e.g. pardons, emergency declarations

## constitutional law

* Fourteenth Amendment

## steps in the felony criminal procedure process

1. **reported crimes**
2. **pre-arrest investigation**
   * not necessarily open to public disclosure until there's an arrest
3. **the arrest**
   * everything from here on is generally considered public record
4. **booking**
   * media typically doesn't identify who's been arrested until they're booked
     * facts could change between arrest and booking
5. **police file formal complaint**
   * typically filed by an officer, but sometimes by victim (e.g. domestic violence)
   * includes signed affidavit attesting to details of complaint
6. **first appearance / presentment / bail hearing**
   * municipal court
   * generally (but not always) within 48 hours of arrest
   * not to be confused with bond
     * judge sets **bail** and allows you to post **bond**
     * bond can be:
       * cash (or property deed)
       * professional (bail bondsman)
         * you pay them a non-refunded fee, they post money for ya
         * if you don't show up, expect bondsmen to send bounty hunters
7. **preliminary hearing**
   * still municipal court
   * bring witnesses/etc to determine if there's **probable cause** to go to grand jury
8. **grand jury review**
   * now in common pleas court
   * grand jury deliberates in secret over probable cause
9. **filing of an indictment**
   * filed if grand jury found probable cause
   * released every Wednesday by court
10. **arraignment on the indictment**
   * another bail hearing basically
   * more serious because you're facing felony now
   * generally (but not always) judge sets same bail as municipal court
     * might be raised if new details have emerged
     * basically never lowered, lol
11. **pre-trial hearings**
    * attorneys filing motions to determine what evidence jury can see
    * judge can see all evidence and be unmoved, but jury could be prejudiced
    * most cases settled here
12. **trial**
    * murder trial typically lasts ~3 weeks
    * often boring but often very not
13. **sentencing**
    * made by the judge based on jury's decision
    * jury can recommend sentencing but judge has final say
14. **appeals**

## steps in the civil procedure process

1. **plaintiff files a complaint**
   - lengthy document laying out accusations
2. **defendant files an answer**
   - brief document refuting complaint
   - 30? days to file
   - if you don't file, complaint assumed true
3. **discovery**
   - depositions and @@@
4. **pretrial hearings**
5. **trial**
6. **appeals**

steps 4–6 are pretty much the same as in criminal

## commonly used terminology

- **demurrer**: motion to dismiss. admit the facts, but contend they constitute nothing wrong
- **verdict**: action by the jury
- **judgment**: decision by the court
- **plaintiff** and **defendent**
- **appellant** or **petitioner**: person appealing decision
- **appelle** or **respondent**: person defending appeal
- **probation** and **parole**: agree to check in and follow some rules
  - probation before prison, parole after prison (generall)
  - if you break the rules, original sentence will be applied
  - considered "forgiveness" by judge, so they're often harsh if you break
- **bail**: set by the judge (legal term)
- **bond**: what you use to make bail (money term)
- **indictment** or **true bill**
- **motions**
- **plea bargain**
  - not binding on the judge, but they usually go for it
- **voir dire**: questioning jurors before trying
  - issue jury summons to ~40 people
  - both sides question jurors to see if they're fair
  - each side can dismiss three jurors for any reason, any further dismissals require cause
