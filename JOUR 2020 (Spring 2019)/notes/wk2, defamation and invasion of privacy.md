# defamation/invasion of privacy

***Wed, 23 Jan 2019***

## defamation

* **definition**: an injury to reputation
* tort to common law (civil matter)
* libel = written, slander = oral

### elements of defamation

all elements must be present for defamation to occur

* **publication**
  * must be communicated to at least one third-party

- **identification**
  * name not needed (if a reasonable man knows who you're talking about...)
- **falsity**
  * $\implies$truth is a defense against defamation
  * either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth
- **fault / standards of liability**
  - three standards: fault, recklessness, knowledge of falsity
  - standard for public officials/figures
    - higher standard of proof
    - must prove Times malice: knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth
  - standard for ordinary people
    - states can choose any standard to apply
    - most states use *negligence* standard (didn't check what they should have checked)
- **damages**
  * even if you win your case, if you weren't damaged, you might be awarded nothing
  * punitive damages: if you're extremely reckless, you may get huge damages to make an example of you

### defenses to defamation

* **truth**
  * *substantially true* â€“ immaterial variations or omissions don't matter
* **privilege**
  * if someone else says something false and you report on it, you're not liable
  * this is why we use "according to X"
* **opinion or fair comment**
  * must be clear that it's your opinion, not fact
  * must be clear what facts your opinion is based on
* **consent**
  * if you got permission from the victim, it isn't defamation
  * you better get consent in writing
  * don't read back your story to the source (or they'll want to change it)
* **reply**
  * if A attacks B, you get reply from B
  * if B's response attack outweighs A's initial attack, you must go back to A for reply
  * provocation revokes defense of reply
* **statute of limitations**
  * 1 year from utterance (in most states)
* **mitigations**
  * uhh he didn't talk about this

## invasion of privacy

- infringement on right to be left alone
  - truth not necessarily a defense
- not in Constitution, but the result of Supreme Court decisions
- four kinds:
  - **appropriation** of name/likeness for commercial purposes
  - **intrusion** upon a person's solitude
  - **publication of private info** about an individual
  - publishing material that puts an individual in a **false light**

###appropriation

* using someone's likeness for advertising without consent
  * e.g. "Lady Gaga loves our shoes" but she didn't agree to that
* **Booth Rule**
  * person's name/likeness can be used in advertisement for program if that person will be part of the content

### intrusion

* unreasonably intruding (phys or otherwise) upon the solitude/seclusion of another
* publication of info is not relevant
* concerns your conduct when newsgathering
* what is "unreasonable" depends
  * not ok: random mother. probably ok: celebrities, person exiting trial

### publication of private info

* publishing info on private life ("key hole" journalism)
  * e.g. health, sexual activities, social or economic affairs, etc
* **reasonable expectation of privacy**
  - activities in public are not protected
* two requirements:
  * the material would offend reasonable person
  * something about public concern

### publicizing in a false light

* only form of invasion of privacy that concerns truth/falsehood
* distorting the truth through exaggerations, tone, etc
* requirements:
  * publication of material that puts someone in false light
  * false light in which individual was placed would be offensive to a reasonable person
  * publisher of the material was at fault when the publication was made
* fault
  * must show actual malice
  * knowledge of falseness or reckless disregard for truth

### defenses against invasion of privacy

1. ???
2. newsworthiness
3. no fault
