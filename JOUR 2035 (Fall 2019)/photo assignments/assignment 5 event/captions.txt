Located at 14th and Main in Over-the-Rhine, MOTR Pub is the host of MOTRmouth, a stand-up comedy show held on the second Tuesday of each month. According to their Facebook page, MOTRmouth is the longest running independent comedy showcase in Cincinnati. (establishing shot)

MOTRmouth is hosted in MOTR Pub's sword room, a small performance space in the venue's basement that features a wall-mounted display of a large sword. According to MOTRmouth host Karl Spaeth, the room used to house several swords, but the others were stored away after one was stolen by a patron. (detail)
