## composition concepts

4 levels of photography:

1. informational
   * showing up, getting a record of the events
2. graphic
3. emotional
4. ...

### concepts

* **rule of thirds**
  * place centrally: divide into two halves
    * symmetry – stability, solidity, regularity
  * place one-third into frame: unequally divided space
    * imbalance – tension, potential for movement
  * looking thru frame vs off the edge:
    * curiosity, dissonance
* **repetition of form**
  * repeated patterns
    * shapes, forms, colors, even people
    * creates structure, comfort, curiosity
  * best w/ strong simple lines, high-contrast bg
* **framing with form**
  * shooting through objects to frame
  * deliberate choice to create structure around focal point
* **framing with light**
  * using contrast of bright areas and dark areas to frame
  * deliberate choice to create structure
* **leading lines**
  * eye naturally follows lines
  * photogs use lines to connect parts of image
    * lead viewer to focal point
    * create motion
  * deliberate compositional action
* **layering**
  * photojournalists want depth in their images
    * incorporating valuable storytelling elements in fg/middle/bg
    * focal point can be any of these positions
* **negative space**
  * large blank spaces, contrasting from your subject
  * creates dynamic separation between objects
  * many possible reactions
    * confusion, clarity, tension, even unity
* **selective focus**
  * eyes refocus very quickly so we don't notice lack of sharpness
  * cameras are differently. good photo can show subject in a way viewer doesn't normally see it.
  * usually achieved w/ shallow depth of field (wide aperture, low f-number)
* **height and angle**
  * show viewer something from a perspective they've never seen
  * low shots create strength, tallness. high shots create weakness, smallness
  * adults/children
