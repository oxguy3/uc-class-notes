# UC class notes
This repository contains some of my notes, assignments, and other files from courses I took at the University of Cincinnati. I'm publishing these files in hopes that someone else might find them useful or informative.

## How to use
I usually like to take notes in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (.md files), a simple text-based markup format. If you are viewing this repository on GitHub.com, it should automatically format these and you should have no issues reading them.

However, I will sometimes embed bits of LaTeX within my Markdown files (primarily in math-y classes). This is a non-standard feature of Markdown, and GitHub.com will not render them properly. I use the desktop app [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) to edit these files, so that's what I'd recommend for viewing them.

## Copyright
The files in this repository consist primarily of my own work, but some of the files may include content from my professors or classmates. It would be too difficult and confusing to try to entirely remove/separate others' work, so I'm not going to put a free license on the repository.

To any of my professors who might be reading this: Hello! I have done my best to exclude your original class materials from this repository and respect your copyright. However, I have included syllabi and some other informational files. If you would like me to take these files down, please email me at [haydenschiff@gmail.com](mailto:haydenschiff@gmail.com).

## Disclaimers
Please do not plagiarize my work or use these to cheat in any way. In most cases, I suspect it would be really obvious that you were using someone else's work, but still, don't try it. If you found this repository via Google or whatever, remember: your professor has Google too.
