## What is journalistic independence?

* Independence: An essential component of journalism practice in which journalists are free to pursue truth with loyalty only to citizens and not particular interests, causes or other pressure, in mind.

## Hastings, in his own words...

* "Look, I went into journalism to do journalism, not advertising. My views are critical but that shouldn't be mistaken for hostile - I'm just not a stenographer. There is a body of work that shows how I view these issues but that was hard-earned through experience, not something I learned going to a cocktail party on fucking K Street. That's what reporters are supposed to do, report the story."

## The objectivity trap

* Commonly used to describe a person's (alleged) ability to completely detach from, and have no opinion or perspective on, a given issue
  * Because people can't really be objective, what we advocate here is seeing objectivity as a quality of the methods journalists employ in their work, not of the journalists themselves.
