# Ch. 5: New Voices, New Models

## key trends

* new funding models for journalism
* changes to the news cycle
* payment for web access to news
* how web search capabilities influence news
* new approaches to local news development

## finances pushing changes in newsroom

* jobs disappearing in journalism/media
  * big list of media outlets and # of jobs cut (total: 2.1k)
  * 1/3 of jobs disappeared since 2017 (i think? might have that wrong)
* watched local ABC video on Denver Post

## non-profit journalism

* news organizations cutting back in the face of shrinking profits
  * investigative reporting
  * statehouse reporting
* non-profits stepping in to fill the gap
  * ProPublica
  * Stateline.org

## paywalls

* news orgs that began their internet life offering content for free now have to backtrack
  * hard paywall: little or no content can be accessed without a paid subscription
  * soft paywall: flexible, offering some stories or a certain number of stories for free before charging
    * "freemium" subscription
* examples
  * WSJ: hard paywall
  * New Yorker: soft paywall, 3 free articles per month

## crowd-funded reporting

* not subscription; not ad-supported
* closest model? member-supported public radio
* main difference? members/donors choose the stories that get reported
* examples
  * Texas Tribune
  * failures e.g. Spot On?, Beacon Reader

## engagement

* legacy media: **traffic**
  * attractting a mass audience is (or was) the goal
  * value defined by number of eyeballs
* online media: **engagement**
  * attracting a smaller, but more involved, audience is the goal
  * value defined by the time spent

## new media ecosystem

* mix of legacy media, start-ups, hybrids
  * aggregators and curators
  * blogs and single-issue "niche" outlets
  * disruptors
  * hybrids emerging
  * corporates re-imagining themselves

## summary

* repeat of "key trends" intro bullet points
* key issue: monetization
  * how to transform free things into paid products
  * new funding models for journalism
