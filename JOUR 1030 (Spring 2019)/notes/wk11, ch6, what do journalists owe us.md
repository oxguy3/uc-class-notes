# Ch. 6: What do Journalists Owe Us?

## key concepts

* journalistic power and responsibility
* defintions of ethics and morality
* prima facie duties
* intuitionism and other ethical theories
* how journalists see their duties
  * codes of ethics
* ethical decision-making framework

## doing your job

doing journalism means wielding power

* real harm can come to real people
  * sources
  * subjects
  * audiences
  * society
* examples
  * baseball player who was quoted in broken English
  * Buffalo News: Croce story "'hanging all over' Kane at SkyBar for at least two hours that night"
  * "The High Cost of Burning a Source" – Minnesota papers
  * Rolling Stone UVA rape story
  * Jayson Blair, plagiarizing NYT journalist
* acting ethically means wielding power responsibly
  * sometimes you have to do more than the bare minimum
  * ethics involves more than being accurate
  * it involves being thorough and truly objective
  * ethically framing and sourcing stories
* example: Ferguson

  * The *peaceful protestors* frame:
    * Emphasizes the righteousness and necessity of peoples' response to murder
  * The *rioters/looters* frame:
    * Emphasizes the criminality of protest, despite the circumstances or the specifics of the incident
    * Links this specific incident to other acts of civil unrest and competing philosophies of ‘direct action’

* example: 2015 Cincinnati shooting
  * early reports focused on police report and statements from officers
  * use of mugshot of victim of shooting vs. official photo of officer
* You "volunteer" to be a journalist, and in doing so, "volunteer" to take on certain responsibilities
  * Journalists are self-policing

## 5 Ways Journalists Can Regain Trust

*from https://www.cjr.org/analysis/trust-journalism.php*

1. Hire more public editors.
2. Make public editing more of a team effort.
3. Don't assume everyone knows what journalism is.
4. Don't assume people understand the process journalism, either.
5. Embrace the idea that we're all teachers and ambassadors—and get aggresive with it.
