# Part 1: Types of Journalism

(several parts copied from [here](http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/journalism/types.html))

## key points

* journalism in 2019 looks different than in previous generations due to substantial changes in media technology
* there are a variety of forms of journalism including:
  * news & reporting
  * feature writing
  * analysis
  * editorials & opinion

## our definition of journalism

Journalism is a set of transparent, independent procedures aimed at gathering, verifying, and reporting truthful information of consequence to citizens in a democracy. (Chapter 2)

## "soft" vs "hard" news

(copied from [here](http://harwoodp.people.cofc.edu/PRWritingCh7Features.ppt))

* Features are considered “’soft”  rather than “hard” news
* Less time-sensitive
* They entertain, provide background, and give consumer tips
* They often show up in specialty sections of the daily newspaper—entertainment, food, business, real estate, automotive, technology
* And most come from public relations sources 

## news

News stories are just that: they focus on events of importance to the paper’s audience. News comes in all varieties: local, regional, national and international.

To cover news, you must…

1. **Be impartial**: ~~You need to present all sides of the story fairly.~~ That means that you must interview all of the pertinent parties involved.
2. **Be accurate**: Because news is based on facts, you have to make sure you get yours right. That means double- and triple-checking statistics, names, dates and other pieces of information.
3. **Have good news judgment**: Space is precious in newspapers and so brevity is essential. You need to be able to identify what is news and what isn’t news, and you need to be able to decide what your audience needs to know and what it could do without.
4. **Never editorialize**: News is all fact, no opinion. Remember that!

## analysis

* These articles are usually called "news analysis"
* They go into more depth than a straight news article, described above, typically would, offering an analysis of events and how it might affect the surrounding area.
* Pieces like this require a great deal of knowledge about the event, the area in which it takes place and the people involved, and thus are usually written by more experienced reporters who specialize in covering certain areas or topics.

## editorials & opinion writing

(mostly copied from [here](https://journalistsresource.org/tip-sheets/writing/how-to-write-an-op-ed-or-column/))

> "the test of excellence being clearness of style, moral purpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion in what the writer conceives to be the right direction" –Pulitzer Org

### Questions to ask yourself when writing an op-ed or column

* Do I have a clear point to make? If so, what is it?
* Who cares? (Writing with a particular audience in mind can inform how you execute your column. Who is it that you are trying to conince? Why are you targeting that specific reader?)
* Is there substance to my argument?

### Distinguishing characteristics of an op-ed or column

* Typically, it is short, between 750 and 800 words.
* It has a clearly defined point.
* It has a clearly defined point of view.
* It represents clarity of thinking.
* It contains the strong, distinctive voice of the writer.

## features

A feature article builds upon the interests of the audience. It opens the door to more creative approaches to traditional, straight news ledes and inverted pyramid formatting.

These stories focus on people and what they like to do, where they live, what they eat, what entertains them. The sky is the limit when it comes to features, but when you’re assigned a feature article, you must make sure that it’s a topic your audience will be interested in.

Features stories include:

1. Profiles of prominent or unique individuals of interest to the community
2. Reviews of books, films, music, restaurants and more
3. Q&A-type interviews
4. Background for certain events or traditions
5. Historical pieces that delve into the past

## summary

* news: what happened
* analysis: what happened and why
* opinion: what i think of it
* features: what is interesting about it

# Journalistic Platforms: "The Medium is the Message"

## key points

* journalism in 2019 looks different than in previous generations due to substantial changes in media technology

## "The Medium is the Message"

>  "The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium—that is, of any extension of ourselves—result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology."
>
> ​	—Marshall McLuhan, 1964

What did he mean?

The advent of new technologies bring with them new ways of seeing the world in which we live

* Examples
  * "Detribalization by literacy and its effects on tribal man"
  * Radio/television and the global village
* Misinterpretations
  * The content of a message is meaningless

> * "There are fundamental differences between oral and literate cultures"
>
> * "That electronic communication is retriving patterns of thought and culture fostered by orality
>
>   —Morrison, 2006

## mediums of publishing

...

## print

* requires mastery of grammar, style and syntax
* a less **rich** medium than visual media, thus requires more from the writer
* skills are more transferable to other media

positions available:

* writers/reporter/columnist
