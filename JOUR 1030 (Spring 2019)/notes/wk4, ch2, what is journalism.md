## A Rape on Campus

* PBS NewsHour video: [How Rolling Stone got the UVA sexual assault story so wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXOYXH3ZsRE)
* RS failed to verify, only source was the alleged victim
* aftermath
  * reputation of RS and victim both ruined
  * RS forced to pay huge settlement to fraternity
* lesson: journalists must have multiple sources backing a story like this
  * even if you believe it's true, if you can't prove it, don't run the story
* source may or may not be lying (sure seems like she is), but ultimately not to blame
  * journalist's job to back up story of an unreliable/shaken witness/source

## citizen journalism

* people w/o professional training using modern tech + Internet to create/augment/face-check media
* examples
  * write about city council mtg on blog/forum
  * fact-check news article from MSM, point out errors/bias on blog

### Example: Twitter, #BLM, Ferguson

* visibility of story, speed of spread, availability of info
  * not possible w/o citizen journalists + social media
* NYTimes video: [#BlackTwitter After #Ferguson](https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000003841604/blacktwitter-after-ferguson.html)
* as a crime journalist, who do you talk to first?
  * police? victim? witnesses?

## credibility based on...

* trustworthiness
* expertise (how do we define it?)

## journalism is not PR/advertising

* first loyalty to client, not the public
* paid and sponsored content is not journalism
* Vogue former director: Michael Kors cover was crap (June 2017)

## summary

Journalism is a set of transparent, independent procedures aimed at gathering, verifying and reporting truthful information of consequence to citizens in a democracy.

* This definition of journalism:
  * helps us make distinctions between journalism and other types of media content
  * focuses on journalism as a process
  * reflects important characteristics from the *Elements of Journalism*
