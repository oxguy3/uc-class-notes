# Thoughts on the First Amendment

## First Amendment

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

## From Article: Things Reporters Get Wrong About the First Amendment

* government action required
* same rights as everyone
* not easy or quick to win defamation cases
* rely on records
* we need a shield law
* no right to private property
  * public access is a right
* liability for republishing â€“ NYT profile

## examples

* News Cameraman Falsely Arrested For Filming Police Suffolk County New York
  * https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/17/cameraman-settles-suit-against-suffolk-police-over-arrest-for-taping-officer/
* Getting It Wrong: The Richard Jewell Case
  * watching video: "Olympic Bombing 1996: Richard Jewell, the Wrong Man | Retro Report | The New York Times"

## Ohio Constitution

I.03 Right to assemble (1851)

> ...

I.11 Freedom of speech; of the press; of libels (1851)

> ...

## privacy and reporting

* privacy, although not explicitly recognized in constitution, is implicitly included
* ... (missed this slide)
* four legal subcategories of privacy torts, or wrongs, are these:
  * intrusion upon physical seclusion (most common)
  * false light (false portrayal of someone, similar to libel or defamation)
  * public disclosure of private facts (objectionably revealing personal information that's of no public concern)
  * appropriation (using someone's name or picture without permission)
* there is often a delicate balance that must be struck between reporting news of public concern and protecting people's privacy.
